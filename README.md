# Game-Project-2-Game-Demo
CS 489 – Topics in CS: Video Game Development (Spring 2025)

You will have to code a working demo version of your game. Your demo game must have
at least 2000 lines of code (blank and comment lines do not count), and contain at least the

following elements:

• At least 4 animations
• At least 2 tweens
• At least one particle effect
• Music and sound effects
• A Start Screen and Game Over screen, with the possibility of replay.

All assets used in your game must be free for educational purposes. Games are
visual media, and therefore, your demo must show effort in its construction. For example,
displaying a blank background will be penalized as it is very easy to use a simple background
image instead.
